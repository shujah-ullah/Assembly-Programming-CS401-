These are practice programs for Assembly Language.

**Prerequisits**
Assembler used is NASM Netwide assembler
To run ASM programs you have to install DOS BOx and in the dos box mount the Directory where NASM.exe is placed. 
For Debugging I have used Aadvanced Free Debugger AFD.

**Assembling Code**
Write assembly program in plain text file and save it with .asm extension i.e EX01.asm
for converting into Machine code follow below given commands
nasm Program.asm -o Program.com  //.com is same as .exe in Old DOS com is used for executable file extension

**Debugging Program**
open executable assembly file with afd by following command:
afd Program.com
